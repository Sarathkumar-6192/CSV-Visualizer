# CSV-Visualizer
Final Project: CSV Visualizer — Interactive Data Charting Tool
Project Overview
The CSV Visualizer is a responsive web application designed to empower users to upload their CSV data files and transform raw tabular data into compelling, customizable graphical visualizations. Built using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Chart.js as the visualization engine, this tool provides an intuitive and modern interface that is both lightweight and highly effective — delivering visual insights similar in quality to advanced libraries like Matplotlib.

Key Features
Simple Upload Interface: Users start with a clear, attractive upload button to load their CSV files.

Dynamic Customization Panel: After uploading, users can select the chart type (bar, line, pie) and choose which columns represent the X and Y axes.

On-Demand Visualization: Charts are rendered only after the user clicks the “Visualize” button, offering control and reducing unnecessary computation.

Responsive & Modern UI: The interface features a solid color theme with clean typography, styled buttons, and intuitive dropdowns, providing a smooth user experience across all device sizes.

Powerful Charting Engine: Leveraging Chart.js ensures highly interactive and visually appealing charts with minimal performance overhead.

Easy to Extend: The codebase is modular and easy to expand with additional chart types, export options, or multi-series support.

Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Charting Library: Chart.js (CDN loaded)

No backend: Fully client-side, no server dependencies or database.
