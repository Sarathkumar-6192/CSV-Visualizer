# CSV Visualizer — Interactive Data Charting Tool

## Project Overview
CSV Visualizer is a responsive web application that allows users to upload CSV files and transform raw tabular data into customizable, visually appealing charts. Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Chart.js, it provides a clean and intuitive interface to help users quickly gain insights from their data — comparable to advanced visualization tools like Matplotlib.

## Features
- **Simple Upload Interface:** Start by uploading any CSV file with ease using an attractive, user-friendly button.
- **Dynamic Customization Panel:** Select chart type (Bar, Line, Pie) and choose which columns to plot as X and Y axes after uploading.
- **On-Demand Visualization:** Charts are rendered only when the user clicks the “Visualize” button, optimizing performance and control.
- **Responsive & Modern UI:** Solid color theme with crisp typography and sleek controls ensure great UX across devices.
- **Powerful Charting Engine:** Utilizes Chart.js for smooth, interactive, and visually stunning charts.
- **Lightweight & Client-Side:** Fully functional without any backend or external dependencies (besides Chart.js CDN).

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) (via CDN)

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click the “Upload CSV File” button and select your CSV.
3. Once uploaded, choose the chart type and columns for the X and Y axes.
4. Click “Visualize” to generate the chart.

## Potential Use Cases
- Quick data visualization for CSV datasets.
- Educational tool for learning data visualization.
- Prototype dashboard or UI components for data-centric apps.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Parsing CSV directly in-browser using JavaScript.
- Dynamically populating dropdowns based on user data.
- Managing chart rendering lifecycle for smooth UX.
- Designing a professional UI with only vanilla web technologies.
- Keeping the tool lightweight while maintaining rich features.

## Future Enhancements
- Support multiple Y-axis columns for multi-series charts.
- Add export options (PNG, PDF).
- Enable dark/light theme switching.
- Add drag-and-drop file upload.
- Connect with external APIs for real-time data visualization.
